<hr>

## Description:
Jbeil is a data-driven framework for self-supervised deep learning on evolving networks represented as sequences of authentication timed events. The premise of this work lies in applying an encoder on a continuous-time evolving graph to produce for each time epoch the embedding of the visible graph nodes, and a decoder that leverage these embeddings to perform LM link prediction on unseen nodes.

## Authentication logs dataset:
