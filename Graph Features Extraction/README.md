## Description:

The **main.ipynb** file comprises an implementation to build graph maps for network-based datasets. The code was tested on the LANL auth.txt.gz dataset ().

The other notebooks are specifically used to extract graph features based on the previously calculated graph maps. Details provided below:

> features-Copy1: *In_Unique_Usr*

> features-Copy1-2: *In_Unique_Src*

> features-Copy1-3: *In_Unique_UsrSrc*

> features-Copy2: *Out_Unique_Usr, Out_Unique_Dst, Out_Unique_UsrDst*

> features-Copy4: *Out_Day_Avg_Usr, Out_Day_Avg_Dst, Out_Day_Avg_UsrDst*
